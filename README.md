# Smart-Bond

##WIP!

In order to test the SmartBond you'll need truffle installed on your local machine.

Use *starttestrpc.sh* to start your local chain.

Then simply do:

**truffle compile**

**truffle test**

To test the bond contract.

**BONUS:** inside the *fundamental_analysis* directory you'll find valuation techniques for bonds written in Javascript such as yield to maturity and the current bond price.

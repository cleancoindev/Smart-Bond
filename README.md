# [WIP] Smart-Bond

## Steps

In order to test the SmartBond, you'll need [truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) and [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) installed on your local machine.

Use `startGanache.sh` to start your local testnet.

Then simply do:

1. `npm install`
2. `truffle compile`
3. `truffle test`

To test the bond contract.

**BONUS:** inside the *js/fundamental_analysis* directory you'll find valuation techniques for bonds written in Javascript such as yield to maturity and the current bond price.
